# MovieSync - Project 2
![App Screenshot](/public/css/images/app-screenshot.png)

## MovieSync App
Moviesync is an entertainment application. It aims to be a space for users to keep track with their movies/tv show watchlist. Moreover, it allows users to customize the list by adding movie/tv show name, genre, and review. 

## Concept 
The concept behind this application came from my habit to create a watchlist for movies and tv shows frequently. The app is built with a nice touch to make it more visually appealing to look at.
